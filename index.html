      <section id="about">
        <p> Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Chicago. I study comparative politics and international political economy. My dissertation aims to address how authoritarian countries can strategically leverage institutional adjustments to mitigate risks and shape foreign economic relations. </p>

        <strong>Quick Fix or Overhaul: Judicial Adjustments to Persuade Foreign Investors</strong><br>
        <em>Abstract</em>
      </summary>
      <p>
        This paper compares how comprehensive reforms and targeted interventions affect foreign investors’ policy learning, explaining why governments with credibility deficits may pursue more systemic reforms. I develop a dynamic model showing that comprehensive judicial reform is more likely when a government urgently needs foreign investment or is targeting investors highly sensitive to judicial risk. To test the model’s predictions, I use a staggered difference-in-differences design with Chinese court-level data from 2014 to 2020, including reform adoption timing, case filings, and local-firm win rates. I find that provinces with greater—but not extreme—exposure to global markets are more likely to adopt real reforms that curb local favoritism. The findings contribute to our understanding of the political economy of trade and legal reform, especially in periods of rising geopolitical uncertainty.

        <strong>Where Corruption Feels Like Home: Institutional Similarities Driving Investment</strong><br>
        <em>Abstract</em>
      </summary>
      <p>
        This paper explores how authoritarian governments, in a multipolar world of “unconditional capital,” strategically shift between Western and non-Western investors, reducing the leverage once linking FDI to institutional reform. I present a dynamic game in which host countries choose alignment based on institutional resemblance to competing hegemons and the expected returns from switching. I test the model using U.S. FDI data from 1982–2023 and Chinese FDI data from 2005–2023, leveraging the 1988 and 2012 amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as natural experiments. The findings challenge the conventional view that FDI from rule-of-law countries always promotes host-country governance improvements.

        <strong>Negotiating Across Dual Dimensions</strong> (with Shiyan Cao)<br>
        <em>Abstract</em>
      </summary>
      <p>
        This paper develops a dynamic model of two-dimensional policy bargaining between a developing country (A) and a Western country (B). Initially, trade cooperation aligns A's economic policy with B’s preferences. Over time, as cooperation deepens, A’s policy space expands, giving it room to diverge on non-economic issues (e.g., environmental or security policy). We show that without a binding treaty, cooperation is sustainable only if the trade benefits outweigh political divergence. With a treaty, A’s policy deviation can be limited. We characterize the space of enforceable treaties and show that even as the treaty’s binding power weakens over time, both countries are better off: cooperation is more stable and uncertainty reduced.
